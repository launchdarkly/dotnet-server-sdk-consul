## Build instructions
 
### Prerequisites

This project has two targets: .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Framework 4.5.2. In Windows, you can build both; outside of Windows, you will need to [download .NET Core and follow the instructions](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (make sure you have 2.0 or higher) and can only build the .NET Standard target.

The unit test project uses code from the `dotnet-server-sdk-shared-tests` repository which is imported as a subtree. See the `README.md` file in that directory for more information.

### Building

To install all required packages:

```
dotnet restore
```

To build all targets of the project without running any tests:

```
dotnet build src/LaunchDarkly.ServerSdk.Consul
```

Or, to build only the .NET Standard 2.0 target:

```
dotnet build src/LaunchDarkly.ServerSdk.Consul -f netstandard2.0
```

### Testing

To run all unit tests, for all targets:

```
dotnet test test/LaunchDarkly.ServerSdk.Consul.Tests
```

Or, to run tests only for the .NET Standard 2.0 target (using the .NET Core 2.1 runtime):

```
dotnet test test/LaunchDarkly.ServerSdk.Consul.Tests -f netcoreapp2.1
```

The tests expect you to have Consul running locally on the default port, 8500. One way to do this is with Docker:

```bash
docker run -p 8500:8500 consul
```
